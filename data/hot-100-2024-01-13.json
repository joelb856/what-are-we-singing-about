it's a little piece of Heav\u0435n when we lay down at night\nShe keeps on loving m\u0435 and I keep on wondering why\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe's got a wicked smile, angel eyes, every guy wanting to hold her close\nShe's as pretty as sin like the sun sinking down on the California coast\n\n[Chorus]\nShe keeps on loving me, loves me the way I am\nShe's not just along for the ride, she's my biggest fan\nLord, it's a little piece of Heaven when we lay down at night\nShe keeps on loving me and I keep on wondering why\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd I don't know what happened, but it sure don't add up on paper\nAnd as long as she lets me, I'll take her wherever she wants me to take her\n\n[Chorus]\nShe keeps on loving me, loves me the way I am\nShe's not just along for the ride, she's my biggest

the dirt\nAnd face the rolling thunder\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm five generations\nOf blazing a trail\nThrough barbed wired valleys and overgrown dells\nI'm barefoot and bareback and born tough as
